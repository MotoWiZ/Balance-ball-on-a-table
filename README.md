Software:
- Raspberry Pi OS
  - Raspbian ver. 11 (bullseye)
  - 32 bit version
  - kernel ver: 5.15
- Rtems on top of Raspbian followed this tutorial with modifications https://mritunjaysharma394.medium.com/installing-rtems-ecosystem-and-building-your-first-bsp-993d1cf38902). This is not needed but I want to play a bit with RTOS, priorities and want to try RTMES kernel for this
- Python language
